# Ebook Store Management System

## Overview
The Ebook Store Management System is a Python-based application that allows bookstore clerks to manage book records in a SQLite database. This project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a command-line interface. It leverages object-oriented principles to ensure modularity and scalability.

## Features
- **Add New Books** – Enter new book records into the database.
- **Update Book Records** – Modify existing book information by ID.
- **Delete Books** – Remove book records by ID, title, author, or delete all records.
- **Search for Books** – Search book records by title, author, or list all books.
- **Formatted Output** – Book records are displayed in a structured format.
- **Persistent Storage** – Book records are stored in a SQLite database (`database.db`).
